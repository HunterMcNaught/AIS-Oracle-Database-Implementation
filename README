**Description of the need for this database** 

The Association for Information Systems is a student lead organization for students who are interested in furthering their professional development relating to Management Information Systems. As the Association for Information Systems grows larger, a database would be of great help to keep track of all records relating to the club. Creating a database with different attributes and entities can allow our executive board team to maintain the club more easily, and also make better data driven decisions. It would also be helpful for AIS board members to have a consolidated database, rather than how we operate currently with separate Google Drives.










**Description of the physical design**

Tables that need to be denormalized 
No normalization is needed. Each attribute is atomic, every attribute that is not a primary or foreign key is fully functional on the dependent on the entire primary key, and there are no transitive dependencies.  
Which entities will have access to functions of the database, which would be insert, read, modify and delete. Any constraints?
Board Members would have access to insert, read, modify, and delete any record in the database. Board members would have access to the results of the attendance of general meetings, payment data, applications and data for the Datathon, corporate tour signups, and lastly applications and data related to the Mentorship Program.
General members will only be able to insert data in the general meeting attendance table
If general members pay a fee, general members will be able to insert and read the Dataset information in the Datathon table
Paid members will be able to insert data in the general meeting attendance table, insert data into the Corporate Tour table, insert data to apply and read the Dataset information in the Datathon table, insert data to apply for our Mentorship Program and read necessary documents 
How are you organizing the files and why?
We would like to organize our files in mySQL Oracle Database. This is the program we learned how to navigate in class. It would make it easier for us to write SQL queries to pull relevant data. 
Brief description of the database recovery policy
Backup
Backup our database everyday at EOD (8:00 pm)
Store database on mySQL backup server
Only current board members will be able to access backup files 
Database Administrator
Assign someone on the technology committee to be our database administrator
Recovery procedure
Identify affected tables or attributes 
Initiate backup or full backup depending on what was affected in the database
